# Key Features

## Extensive Use of Generics
ServiceBricks leverages generics extensively, allowing the compiler to generate a significant portion of the required code needed, reducing development effort and promoting code reusability.

## Templated, Repository-based, REST API Services
Quickly expose standard CRUD methods or define new methods using templated, repository-based, REST API services, accelerating service development and promoting consistency across your microservices.

## ServiceQuery
Leverage ServiceQuery to support standardized, polyglot data querying across SQL and NoSQL database engines, enabling seamless data access and integration.

## Business Rule Engine and Polymorphic Techniques
Build business logic once using polymorphic techniques and apply it to any supported object, promoting code reusability and maintainability. The built-in Business Rule engine allows for flexible and extensible business logic implementation.

## Domain-Driven Design and Event-Based Design
Customize business logic for any supported object and method using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Event-Based Design principles, ensuring your services align with your specific business requirements.

## Background Processes, Tasks, and Rules
Support for asynchronous processing through background processes, tasks, and rules, enabling efficient and scalable execution of long-running operations.

## Service Bus Engine

## Polyglot Multi-Database Engine Support
ServiceBricks offers out-of-the-box support for SQL and NoSQL database engines, including AzureDataTables, CosmosDb, InMemory, MongoDb, Postgres, SQLite, and SQL Server, enabling polyglot persistence and technology choices tailored to your needs.

### NuGet Packages
All ServiceBricks packages are published via NuGet, enabling rapid development and integration of new services and applications.

### Comprehensive Testing Framework
ServiceBricks includes a full Xunit unit test package, ensuring your microservices function correctly within the platform. Achieve over 50% unit test code coverage and over 75% integration test coverage with just a few files and lines of code.
