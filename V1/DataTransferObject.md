# Data Transfer Object (DTO)
In the context of microservices, a Data Transfer Object (DTO) is a lightweight object that serves as a data structure for transporting information between different parts of an application. 

## Purpose of DTOs

### Isolation and Modularity

Microservices are modular and isolated components that work together to form an application. Each microservice may have its own data model.

### Data Exchange
To exchange data between microservices, we create shared DTOs. These DTOs contain relevant fields and do not include business logic.

### REST APIs
When microservices communicate with each other through REST APIs, they use DTOs to pass data.

### Domain Models vs. DTOs
In microservices, domain models (representing the application domain) are separated from the data models because we donâ€™t want to expose the complexity of the domain to clients.

# The Solution for Storage Agnostic APIs

## IDataTransferObject
In order for us to support multiple database engines, we must first overcome two major hurdles.

* Identifying an object in both a relational (SQL) and document (NoSQL) database engine.

Object are typically identified with a primary key. There may be one or many keys in order to identify it, as well as each using different data types.

* Querying for objects in both a relational (SQL) and document (NoSQL) database engine.

This is the reason we built [ServiceQuery](https://github.com/holomodular/ServiceQuery) and have included it into the ServiceBricks platform!

```csharp
    using ServiceBricks;

    public interface IDataTransferObject
    {
        string StorageKey { get; set; }
    }

    public interface IDataTransferObject<TDto> : IDataTransferObject
    {
    }
```

## Using the StorageKey property
Our solution to this problem is to map all primary keys down to a single string value called the **StorageKey**.
We can do this because all .NET datatypes can be serialized down to a string value. 
Then all we need to do is use a suitable delimeter to separate each value when combining them or splitting them.
AutoMapper is the perfect tool to help accomplish this and the reason for its inclusion into the platform.
